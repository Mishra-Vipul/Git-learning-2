rebase -> taking a single or multiplt commits and applying them on a base.
It can be assumed that it is used to merge branches to create a linear work flow and a clean commit history.

command:
git rebase <branchname>


git rebase interactive -> this command is used to slect all the commits that we want to keep in out main branch.


rebase should only be done if we are the only one working on the repo.

git merge <branchname> is used to merge a branch <branchname> into the current active branch.

if there is a linear flow between the <branchname> and current active branch then the terminal displays "fast forwarding".

to delete a branch 'a' after merging it into another branch 'b',
we first have to checkout to branch 'b', and from that branch, we use the command:

git branch -d <branchname>

to delete the branch 'a'.

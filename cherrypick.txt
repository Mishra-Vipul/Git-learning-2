cherrypick is a command which is used to get a commit of branch 'a' to branch 'b'.


In this command, the commit does not gets moved, but a copy of that commit is made and used in branch 'b'.


why?
undoing changes.
team work
resolving a bug by using a commit in which that bug is already resolved


command:
git cherry-pick <commit name>


by default, GIT will only apply these changes if the current branch does not have these changes 
in order to prevent an empty commit.
